Superbowl Sunday  
2019-02-03

## 12:00 First Musings

The number one thing that prevents me from blogging is agreeing with myself on a "blog format" - should I have specific sections that I always try to flesh out, like `Goals`, `Progress Report`, `Health`, etc?
In the interest of getting the damn thing started, I'm going to give myself a grace period and just ramble about a few things.

Formatting for now will *intentionally* be hard to follow.

I probably don't exercise enough, or sleep well enough, or eat correctly.

I'm reading some books but I spend more time on idle entertainment, namely YouTube. It used to be Reddit but I only blip over there to get a distorted view of politics nowadays.

I don't want to "monk"-ify myself ... that is, to disavow any worldly pleasures and seek some sort of perfect understanding. However I do want to practice acting in what I can geniuinely call my best interests, as I understand them, while giving myself the lease to evolve that understanding.

My audience for this blog is *"The Public"*, meaning that nothing should be considered "taboo" to talk to me about in person, though that also means I will usually be assuming a more professional personality, especially as this is on GitHub which is proxy to my vocation as a web developer. This also means that I expect technical topics will come up fairly often - note, I do like what I do :)

A thought - I may update the blog multiple times per day (really setting up high expectations now) and I will attempt to make each update labeled by time and sectioned

Currently, it is Superbowl Sunday. I have around 4 hours until I head to a viewing party at my office. I'd like to get my meal prep done for the week before I head over. I'm thinking:

| Meal | Food | Serving | Fat | Carbs | Protein | Calories |
| :--- | --- | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: | ---: |
| Breakfast | [24 Hour Yogurt](https://www.kingsoopers.com/search?query=50284&searchType=natural) | [`1 cup`](https://longmontdairy.com/nutrition/) | `8g` | `11g` | `8g` | `150` |
| Breakfast | [Almond Granola](https://www.nutritionix.com/i/cascadian-farm/granola-fruit-and-nut/51d2fb71cc9bff111580dcad) | `0.5 cup` | `7g` | `33g` | `4.5g` | `200` |
| Breakfast | [Boulder Sausage](https://bouldersausage.com/products/italian-links/) | `1 link` | `15g` | `1g` | `13g` | `180` |
| Lunch | [Paleo Pho](https://nomnompaleo.com/post/157517114578/instant-pot-pressure-cooker-chicken-pho/cookbook-print/3871) | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |
| Dinner | "Stir Fry Veggies + Egg" | ? | ? | ? | ? | ? |

This sounds good enough to me - I don't know too much of the nutrition facts on lunch / dinner but I think I will be overall pretty low on carbs for the day... I will experiment with adding a banana for lunch.

I also need to read 50-60 pages of *[Becoming](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Becoming_(book))* today, which so far is a pretty good book.

I would also like to come up with a new chord progression on the piano - lately I have been doing:  
`C Maj` > `E dim` > `F Maj` > `E dim`, which sounds kinda jazzy?

I'm going to walk to the grocery store so I can make my meals. Maybe I could find some new music to listen to.
