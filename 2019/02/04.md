## 15:40 Planning Trip
SF for a wedding in July, may be able to spend time with the parents!

Two ideas on my mind currently:
  - A pattern of goal-setting and achievement is rewarded with positive emotion
  - Loving oneself as a primary objective
  
 Most self-help style books I've read will try to teach both in various balances, usually referencing studies on rats and humans (and lobsters?) One of the tools was to break down long term and short term goals, then prioritize.  I will now try that. In no particular order:

It's nearly 23:00 now so I should go to bed soon, but I'll at least try to figure out what I should do tomorrow.  
Hopefully ordered by earliest possible start
