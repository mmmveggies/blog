## 23:09 Actually quite tired
As mentioned, I am quite tired. Sleep was a bit evasive last night, but overall the day was pretty good and I think I made good on just about all my goals except one...

So yeah I should do that tomorrow. I'll set the same goals again for them, for the most part. I'll organize more when it wouldn't be eating into sleep time.

Also, my parent's dog Daisy died today. :(
