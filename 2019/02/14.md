## 18:52 A feel-good data pattern
State management in frontend applications is a pain. I've yet to feel like I've *figured it out*, but today I came up with a pattern that makes me feel pretty good.

I'm using `typescript`, `react` (w/hooks), `redux`, and `redux-thunk`. I did take a look at `redux-sagas`, but I'm still learning `redux` and I think the way I have things keeps it easy to migrate over if I ever wanted to.

Let me give you some context about the application I'm working on:
- It uses a JSON REST API
- It is electron-like
- It does not have access to `localStorage` and the frontend does not attempt to "cache" in general
- User configurations / "navigation" state must be persisted

First, all API endpoints are defined by a simple function signature
```ts
type APIEndpoint<Res, Req = void> =
  (req: Req) => Promise<Res>
```

An `AsyncReducer` can consume an `APIEndpoint`

```ts
// This conforms to the "Redux Standard Action", sans "type"
interface Loadable<State> {
  payload: State | Error;
  error?: boolean;
  meta: {
    loading?: boolean;
    lastUpdated?: Date;
  };
}

// The `reducer` can be added to a 
// redux store with `combineReducers`.
//
// The `dispatcher` is a "thunk" dispatcher
// that knows what to do, given the `req` payload.
// 
// If you call the `dispatcher` from anywhere,
// it will know how to update it's state based on the result of the 
// `makeRequest` function you pass in
interface AsyncReducer<State, Req> {
  reducer: Reducer<Loadable<State>>;
  dispatcher: (req: Req) => ThunkAction<any, Loadable<State>, any, any>;
}

// A function that creates a `reducer` and `dispatcher` pair
// for consumption with `redux`
type createAsync = <State, Req>(
  // A prefix for the piece of state that
  // this reducer should work with, it will dispatch
  // `${prefix}_REQUEST`,
  // `${prefix}_RESPONSE`, and 
  // `${prefix}_ERROR` actions.
  prefix: string,

  // A function that, given a request payload and the current state,
  // returns a promise that resolves to the next state,
  // the state specific to this AsncReducer.
  //
  // Often times I do not need the second argument as the function
  // is simply the `APIEndpoint` and I use the response as the next state.
  makeRequest: (payload: Req, state: Loadable<State>) => Promise<State>,

  // If your state can be `undefined`, this can be `undefined`,
  // though for me it has been simpler to just 
  // create a sane default state and know that it will
  // "never" be used
  initialState: State,

  // a flag that will additionally set the state to the request payload
  // before it sends, still setting it to the resolved state when
  // the `makeRequest` function resolves.
  // This helps prevent UI jenk in certain situations where your `Req`
  // can be used as the state while `makeRequest` is unresolved.
  eager?: boolean
): AsyncReducer<State, Req> 
```

Hmm. I will have to come back to this.
