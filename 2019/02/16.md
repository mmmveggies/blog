## 17:41 Half-day of skiing and three cups of cafÃ© con leche
Woke up around 11:30, took the bus to ski for 2 hours with Mercedes - had a good time overall but I get nervous with how... good those bus drivers are at going fast.  
After a chapter of *Becoming* (yes I am still not done - in fact I'm at page 133 of 416) and three cups of coffee, I'm ready to actually do more justice to what I had originally been intending to write on VDay, which is...


# State Management in React Applications!
So you're writing a `react` application - you need to manage state in your application, which consumes an API with endpoints that:

1) Serve as "storage" for user preferences like navigation state or selected theme
2) List metadata about resources available to the user
3) Fulfill searches of content within those resources

Life's better with examples so let's flesh out an API that serves our purposes:

```
-- Either fetch or update arbitrary JSON data,
-- the backend doesn't care about the shape of this
-- but it is nice and stores it for us!
/preferences
  GET  () => data
  POST (data) => data

-- Fetch a list of groups available to the user,
-- whose token is always sent in the header. 
-- Otherwise, there are no "arguments" to this endpoint.
/groups
  GET () => GroupSummary[]

-- Search items in a group, using whatever kind of query
-- structure your app understand (elasticsearch, etc)
/group/:groupId/items
  GET (query) => Item[]
```

The data from our API endpoints affects our application in different ways:
- `/preferences` - can be updated very often, and many components at varying depths
