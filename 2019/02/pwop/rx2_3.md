IDENTIFY SITUATIONS IN WHICH YOU HAVE BEEN TEMPTED TO FOLD
---

#### Within Myself
I can get caught up telling myself that *I should*...
- be more social
- be stronger
- be more helpful
- be more honest / frank

I fear...
- isolation
- misfortune
- losing all courage
- losing control

I strongly desire...
- to stay cool
- to keep learning
- to stay healthy
- to rise up ranks
- to enjoy life

I combat bullying thoughts by...
- making progress on something
- distracting myself
- trying to take alternative perspectives

#### Interpersonally
I can fold at home when...
- there's a mess and I don't want to pester people
- when there are new people around and I feel anxious
- when I get too introverted and feel like I don't have a handle on my feelings
- when I feel like it would be hypocritical of me to say something

I can fold at work when...
- I'm not well enough plugged into the details being debated
- I convince myself that it will work itself out anyway
- when I'd rather be doing something else
- when I'm not confident in the area and would rather do something I know I'm good at
- when I don't have a good grasp on priorities
- when I can convince myself I have no personal stake in the matter

I can fold in public when...
- I feel obligated to be a certain way
- when there's a lull in conversation I can succumb to the silence
- when I think someone needs special treatment but get defensive anyway

I can fold in tough times when...
- I feel like I keep falling off the bandwagon
- When it seems like there's just too much paperwork 
- with stuff that needs to be regularly scheduled
- when I get frustrated that others don't share my values
